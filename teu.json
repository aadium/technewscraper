The truth is, however, that AI has permeated the gaming industry and shaped video games since the very beginning. Until multiplayer games emerged from the neon-drenched arcades of the 80s, gamers played against AI opponents, like the paddle in the 1972 classic Pong. The capabilities of AI have snowballed since then, with recent developments ushering in the era of generative AI, which is set to fundamentally change gaming as an industry and a medium."

The drop in valuations in 2022, alongside prolonged economic volatility, had led many to conclude that this will be something of a barren year. Though we are unlikely to see the “gold rush” madness of 2021 any time soon, I disagree that 2023 will be a year of doom and gloom for the venture industry. Quite the opposite. There is strong evidence to support the view that both 2023 and 2024 will be years remembered for exciting startups and landmark VC deals."

In the meantime, methane leaks alone account for 4 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions and annual losses of $7 billion in the European and North American markets... and counting.  Equipped with a hydrogen fuel cell, the HyLighter is a cross between drone and airship technology. Like a drone, it is easy to control and transport. It enables precise data collection over long distances in a sustainable way."
